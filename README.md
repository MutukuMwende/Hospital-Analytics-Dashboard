# **Healthcare Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project**

## **About the Project**
Hi there! This project was an exciting deep dive into healthcare efficiency, built for a fictional consulting company, *HealthStat*. Using a real-world dataset, I explored the key factors driving **Length of Stay (LOS)** and healthcare costs. My goal was to uncover actionable insights through data analysis and visualization while building a dynamic, easy-to-navigate Power BI dashboard that helps benchmark hospital performance.

## **What I Did**
### **1. Built a Dynamic Dashboard**
- **Home Page**: I designed a clean starting point with navigation buttons that guide you to different sections of the dashboard.
- **Navigation Buttons**: You can jump to:
  - **Length of Stay Comparison**: This section compares how different health service areas impact patient LOS.
  - **Cost Comparison**: Here, you’ll see cost trends and how various services stack up in terms of expenses.
  - **Hospital Profiles**: This section dives into individual hospital performance and profiles.

### **2. Analyzed the Data**
- **Length of Stay (LOS)**: I identified trends and factors impacting LOS while flagging outliers for performance improvement.
- **Cost Analysis**: I explored cost variations to understand what drives expenses across service areas.
- **Hospital Benchmarking**: This was about comparing facilities to highlight high performers and areas needing attention.

### **3. Added Interactivity**
I wanted the dashboard to feel intuitive and engaging, so I:
- Added interactive visuals and tooltips to provide deeper insights on hover.
- Designed slicers and filters for users to focus on specific hospitals, services, or timeframes.
- Created dynamic titles to make each section feel relevant and contextual.

## **How to Use the Dashboard**
1. **Start at the Home Page**:
   - It’s your main gateway. From here, use the buttons to dive into specific analyses.  
2. **Explore the Sections**:
   - **Length of Stay Comparison**: Compare LOS across different health services.  
   - **Cost Comparison**: Find out which services are cost-effective and which are expensive.
   - **Hospital Profiles**: Take a closer look at individual hospitals, their attributes, and performance benchmarks.
3. **Interact with the Visuals**:
   - Hover over charts for extra details.
   - Use filters to narrow your focus by hospitals, time periods, or other criteria.
4. **Export and Share**:
   - Insights are easily exportable for presentations or reports.

## **What I Learned**
This project was a blend of creativity and technical skills:
- I honed my **DAX skills** by building measures and calculated columns to dig deeper into the data.
- Working on **data modeling**, I transformed raw data into a meaningful structure.
- I pushed my **design skills**, incorporating branding and user-friendly navigation to make the dashboard visually appealing and practical.

Creating this dashboard was not just about crunching numbers but about telling a story with data. It’s a project I’m really proud of, and I hope it showcases the power of Power BI in making complex healthcare data understandable and actionable.
